# WSW

## Email
WSW currently supports sending mail notification through following accounts:
*	GMAIL
*	OUTLOOK

Update following attributes of **email** node in **mail.config.xml**

| Attribute             | Meaning                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|

## Password

After first run, WSW.exe.config will contain the encrypted **secure** section. No need for plain password after that.
